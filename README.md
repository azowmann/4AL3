# COMPSCI 4AL3 - Applications of Machine Learning Course

## This repository contains my assignments completed from COMPSCI 4AL3, a ML course I took during the fall 2024 term at McMaster University

### Each Assignment is described below

### Assignment 1: GDP vs Happiness and Abalone Age Prediction

This project consists of two parts:
1. **Linear Regression on GDP vs Happiness Data**: A linear regression model is implemented to analyze the relationship between GDP per capita and happiness scores using gradient descent and ordinary least squares (OLS).
2. **Polynomial Regression on Abalone Age Prediction**: A polynomial regression model is used to predict the age of abalones (measured in rings) based on physical measurements, with k-fold cross-validation for evaluation.
